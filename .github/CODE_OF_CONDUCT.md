* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience

* Build collaboratively. Each of us owns the problems we face in the company because we are building something that matters, we do that as a team
* Move fast, take controlled risks
* Never stop learning
* Seek the root cause, solve the real problem. Question people and facts
* Set and operate under high standards for ourselves and what we want to achieve
* Focus on delivering real value for our customers
* Recruit people better than you, people you admire
* Be humble. No politics and no ego allowed
* We use our resources wisely
